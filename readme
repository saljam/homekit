this repository has a number of custom homekit accessory proxies to
interface with other systems or older hardware. they're all written
in go.

hklaxon, hknock, and hkdoor use the relays and inputs on a sequent i2c
on a raspberry pi. https://sequentmicrosystems.com/

hkam: proxies regular rtsp cameras, e.g. axis ones, to homekit. this
	doesn't reencode the h.264 stream so it's quite efficient.

hknx: exposes knx devices as homekit accessories. knx is a european
	building automation system.

hklaxon: use motion and contact sensors (like in most traditional
	burglar alarm systems) connected to the inputs on a sequent
	card to expose a homekit security device,

hknock: doorbell and gate opener to interface with an old school
	videx intercom system.

hkdoor: electric strike door opener.


TODO

hkam: 
	- audio out
	- audio in
	- remove ffmpeg dependency for snapshots
	- implement homekit secure video
